# YoRPG_Blacktop
  We have added a magic system to our game, with two unqiue spells for every character.
  We have created a magicPromp() method and two spell methods in every Character class and subclass (except monster). We have also edited the YoRPG file so that the magic option may be selected.
  To play: Download the YoRPG directory, connect to it through your terminal. Then $javac YoRPG.java then $java YoRPG and follow the on-screen instructions.
  Have Fun!
