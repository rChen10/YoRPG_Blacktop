# YoRPG_Blacktop
\tWe have added a magic system to our game, with two unqiue spells for every character.\n
\tWe have created a magicPromp() method and two spell methods in every Character class and subclass (except monster). We have also edited the YoRPG file so that the magic option may be selected.\n
\tTo play: Download the YoRPG directory, connect to it through your terminal. Then $javac YoRPG.java then $java YoRPG and follow the on-screen instructions.\n
\tHave Fun!
